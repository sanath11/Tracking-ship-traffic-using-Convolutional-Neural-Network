# Tracking-ship-traffic-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

#### Developed a Convolutional Neural Network model to detect Ships in Satellite Image based on distinct features in the images.
#### Extracted the dataset from Planet satellite imagery collected over the San Francisco Bay and San Pedro Bay areas of California and modeled the network using Keras library in Python.
